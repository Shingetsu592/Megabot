# Megabot 

1. Encoder_trial using encoder to run the robot based on the arena track
2. Previous used code was Main/Test_Main_Eksbot_2, but TCS34725 sensor was broken
   However in the case of the sensor not being broken, it is expectedÂ that the robot will run according to the task
3. Encoder trial should fixed and changed to using ppr not just counting the rotation input voltage
